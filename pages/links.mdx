# Link Component
**Contributed by Yingjian Di**

This is an extension component of a button.
Link component is used to jump to external link.

## Basic Component
### Design:
The `Link` component uses a button from the UI library styled as a child component to wrap a hyperlink (`<a>` tag). This setup enhances the link by giving it the visual appearance and interactive features of a button, thus making it more prominent and user-friendly. It also comprises several card-specific components like `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, and `CardFooter`. The link itself is placed in the `CardFooter` and is designed to invite users to "Read more" about the content presented in the card. 

### How to behave:
The component behaves like a traditional link but is visually represented as a button, providing a more engaging user interaction than a standard text link.The link takes users directly to the specified URL when clicked. 
### How to use it:
- Installation
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the Link component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button 
```
- Usage:
To integrate the `Button` component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```
```
<Button asChild>
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" >
        Read More →
      </a>
    </Button>
```
