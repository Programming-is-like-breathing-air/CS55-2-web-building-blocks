# Alerts Component
**Contributed by Hexin Zheng**

## 1. Design:

The `Alert` component is a React component designed for displaying important messages, warnings, or notifications to users. It uses the `Alert` element from the Shadcn UI library, which supports multiple variants such as 'info', 'success', 'warning', and 'error'. These variants help in conveying different levels of urgency and types of messages, each with unique styling for background color, icon, and text formatting, consistent with the library's design system.

## 2. How to behave:

The `Alert` component is primarily a static display element meant to provide immediate feedback or crucial information to the user. It doesn't include interactive elements by default, focusing instead on delivering clear and concise messages. However, it can be dismissed if configured with a close button, allowing users to hide the alert when it is no longer needed. Or status button help user to check alert status.

## 3. How to Use the Alert Component

### 3.1. Installation:

Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Alert` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command:
```
npm install @radix-ui/react-icons lucide-react
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert
```

### 3.2. Usage:

To integrate the `Alert` component into your React application, copy the provided React code snippet:
```
import { RocketIcon, InfoCircledIcon, CrossCircledIcon, CheckCircledIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons"; //Change the icon whatever you like
import { ExclamationTriangleIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from "@/components/ui/alert";
```

### 3.3. Rendering the Component:

Embed the `Alert` component within your JSX code where you want it to be displayed:
```
<Alert>
  <RocketIcon className="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle>Heads up!</AlertTitle>
</Alert>
```

### 3.4. Customization:

Customize the `Alert` component by modifying its style, event handlers, and functionality to match the design and requirements of your application. The following are some examples of variants of `Alert`.
## Basic Component

### Appearance
Alerts user by message. You can define the color and the theme of Alert yourself.
<Alert />

### Animation

<Animation />

## Variants

### With description

<WithDescription />

### With list
The detailed information of alert can also be shown as a list.
<WithList />

### With accent border
<WithBorder />

### With link
You can add link in the alert.
<WithLink />

### With dismiss button
Default alert component will be close automatically. You can also add a dismiss button, so that user can close by clicking button.
<WithDismiss />

### With actions
An actionable alert can help users to understand the alert and have further actions.
<WithAction />

## Usability

<details>
    <summary>Make alert banners actionable</summary>
    Whenever possible, add action button if there's a way for a user to quickly address the issue associated with an alert.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Consider including a close button</summary>
    The close button is optional, depending on context. Consider adding one to let a user easily dismiss the alert.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Use the color appropriately</summary>
    Don’t use yellow or orange colors for errors because the contrast is not accessible.
    If you need to show a “notice” message or other non-critical communication, use the blue (informative) semantic color options. Reserve the red (negative) option only for errors that directly interrupt or block a user’s experience — not for nice-to-know information.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Place alert banners at the top</summary>
    Alert banners should appear at the top of a page.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Don't stack alert banners</summary>
    Don't show multiple alert banners at the same time. If a new alert appears with a higher priority message, it should replace an existing alert of lesser importance until the higher priority one has been addressed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Overlay content</summary>
    Overlay an alert when it's expected to fade in and out without impacting the content underneath it, and when it's not hiding any important actions or information by being there. An alert should only overlay content if it is dismissible.
</details>

## Accessibility

### Add Sound when alert are triggered
For some visually impaired people, adding a corresponding prompt sound to ensure that the visually impaired users are aware the alerts and improve their fluency in using the webpage.
<SoundAlert />
