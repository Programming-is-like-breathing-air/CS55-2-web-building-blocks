# Modal Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu**

A Modal overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window, rendering the content underneath inert.

## Basic Modal Component

### Design:
The `PictureModal` component is constructed using various custom UI components including Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription, and DialogFooter to create a modal dialogue. It features an image of a university building and a text description outlining personal information rights under New South Wales and European Economic Area privacy laws. The content area of the dialogue box, DialogContent, is styled with a white background and rounded corners, making it visually appealing and easy to read, while the clear layout of the image and text ensures that the information is easily digestible for users. 

### How to behave: 
- Interaction Response:
Users initiate the display of the dialog by clicking a button labeled "Open Model". The dialog includes two buttons at the bottom: "Accept" and "Cancel". Clicking the "Accept" button triggers a toast notification informing the user that they have "Already Accepted", while clicking the "Cancel" button closes the dialog.

- Feedback Mechanism:
The Toaster component is used to display toast notifications, providing immediate feedback on user actions. The DialogClose component is associated with the "Cancel" button, allowing users to directly close the dialog by clicking the button, thereby enhancing the user experience.

### How to use it: 
- Installation 
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Radio Group` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
``` 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add radio-group
```
- Usuage
To integrate the these component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { z } from "zod"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
    Form,
    FormControl,
    FormField,
    FormItem,
    FormLabel,
    FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form"
import { RadioGroup, RadioGroupItem } from "@/components/ui/radio-group"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/toast/use-toast"
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toast/toaster";

```

- Customization:
Developers can modify the content, style and picture within the toast call to suit various contexts.

## Sign Up and Login Modal

### Design:
The `LoginModal` component utilizes the useState hook to manage form mode (login or signup), email, password, and password confirmation inputs. It is built using custom UI components such as Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogFooter, Input, and Label to construct a modal dialog box. The trigger button of the dialog box changes its text based on the current form mode. Inside, the modal uses flexible Flexbox layout and structured spacing to organize form elements, ensuring a tidy and functional user interface. The Button component serves as both the form's submission button and the mode-switching link, with different style variants to visually distinguish its functions.

### How to behave: 
- Form Processing:
The form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` function, which prevents the default form submission behavior and executes login or signup operations based on the current form mode. During login, it displays the user's email, and during signup, it checks for password consistency. The `useToast` hook is utilized to display results of the operations, such as successful login, successful signup, or mismatched passwords errors.

- Mode Switching:
Users can switch the form mode by clicking on text links, toggling between login and signup as needed. This adds flexibility to the component, allowing users to choose the appropriate action based on their needs.

### How to use it: 

- Integration Method:
Integrate the LoginModal component into React applications that require user authentication. This could be used on a website's login page or any section where users need to log in or register to access additional resources. The modal dialog format provided by the component is suitable for performing authentication without interrupting the user's current activities.

- User Interaction:
Users open the form by clicking the dialog's trigger button labeled “Login” or “Sign Up”. They fill in their email and password according to the prompts; in signup mode, they also need to fill in a confirmation password. Text links at the bottom of the form allow for flexible switching between login and signup modes.
