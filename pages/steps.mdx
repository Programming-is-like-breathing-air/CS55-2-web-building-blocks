# Steps Component

**Contributed by Xinyu Chen**

The Table component is designed to display structured data in a tabular format, ideal for comparison, organization, and presentation of details in a clear and concise manner.

<StepsBasic/>

### Design:
The `StepsBasic` component provides a straightforward and functional design to showcase different subscription plans available to users. This component uses a simple table layout that includes a table header, body, and footer to organize and display data effectively. The use of minimalistic styling ensures that the information is the focal point, making it easy for users to compare options.

### How to behave:
- Static Display: The table is non-interactive and serves as a static display of information. Each row represents a different plan, clearly separating each plan's name, price, and included features.
- Responsive Layout: Although not explicitly defined in the code, the table should be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes to ensure readability and accessibility on various devices.
- Accessibility Features: Semantic HTML tags used in the table enhance accessibility, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate the content.
