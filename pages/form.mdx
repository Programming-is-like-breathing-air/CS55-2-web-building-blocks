#### Design:
The MultiStepForm component is designed to facilitate a multi-step data entry process, capturing a variety of user information through four distinct steps. The component is structured using the following elements:
- **Card Layout**: Encapsulates the entire form within a visually appealing card interface that includes a header, content section, and footer.

#### How to behave:
- Input Fields: Depending on the step, users are required to input different types of information such as names, contact details, birthday, and account credentials.
- Step Navigation: Users can navigate between steps using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The form checks the completion of required fields before allowing progression to the next step.
- Validation: Each step includes validation to ensure required fields are not left blank. If validation fails, a toast notification is displayed prompting the user to complete the necessary fields.
- Submission: After filling all fields across the steps and reaching the final step, clicking "Submit" finalizes the data entry. A toast notification confirms the successful registration and welcomes the user.
