# Breadcrumbs Component

**Contributed by Hexin Zheng**

## 1. Design:

The `Breadcrumb` component is a React component designed for enhancing site navigation by providing a hierarchy of links and helping users understand their location within the website. It uses the `Breadcrumb` element from the Shadcn UI library, which supports a structured layout for displaying a path of links leading to the current page. This helps in creating a better user experience by providing clear and direct navigation paths.

## 2. How to behave:

The `Breadcrumb` component is primarily a navigational aid that helps users trace their steps back through the website's structure. It does not include interactive elements beyond navigation links, focusing instead on guiding users back and forth in the website hierarchy seamlessly. Each part of the breadcrumb can be interacted with, allowing users to return to previous states or pages efficiently.

## 3. How to Use the Breadcrumb Component

### 3.1. Installation:

Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Breadcrumb` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command:
```
npx shadcn-ui@latest  add breadcrumb
```
### 3.2. Usage:

To integrate the `Breadcrumb` component into your React application, copy the provided React code snippet:
```
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink, BreadcrumbList, BreadcrumbPage, BreadcrumbSeparator } from "@/components/ui/breadcrumb";
```
### 3.3. Rendering the Component:

Embed the `Breadcrumb` component within your JSX code where you want it to be displayed.

### 3.4. Customization:

Customize the `Breadcrumb` component by modifying its style, event handlers, and functionality to match the design and requirements of your application. This could include adjusting link styles, separator characters, or adding new interactive or dynamic elements to enhance navigation.
