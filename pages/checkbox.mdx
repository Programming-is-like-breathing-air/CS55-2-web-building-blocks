# Checkbox Component

**Contributed by Nuojin Zhang**

A checkbox component allows users to make a binary choice.

## Basic Checkbox Component

### Design:
This component utilizes the Checkbox component from the UI library to create interactive checkboxes. 
Each checkbox is accompanied by a label for better accessibility and user experience.
The use of a toast notification system provides feedback to the user when a checkbox is clicked, informing them of the action they performed.

### How to behave:
- **Default Checkbox**:
      Clicking on the default checkbox triggers a toast notification with the message "Checkbox Clicked", indicating that the checkbox has been interacted with.
- **Checked State Checkbox**:
   This checkbox is initially in the checked state.
   Clicking on the checkbox also triggers a toast notification with the message "Checkbox Clicked", indicating that the checkbox has been interacted with.

### How to use Checkbox Component:
- Installationï¼š
   Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project. If not, install them using npm by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add checkbox

   import { Toaster } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toaster";
   ```
