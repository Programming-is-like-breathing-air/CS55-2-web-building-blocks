# Tabs Component

**Contributed by Nuojin Zhang**

import Tabs from "../components/ui/tabs";

### Design:
This component represents a tabbed interface that allows users to switch between different content sections. It utilizes the Tabs and TabsContent components from the UI library to create the tabbed layout. Each tab corresponds to a specific category of content, such as "Recent", "Popular", and "Trending". The content for each tab is displayed in separate sections below the tabs.

### How to behave:
- Tab Selection: Clicking on a tab triggers the corresponding content to be displayed below the tabs.
- Each tab represents a different category of content, such as recent, popular, or trending items.
- The content within each tab dynamically changes based on the selected tab.

### How to use it:
- Installation:
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project. If not, install them using npm:
```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
```
- Usage:
      - Import the required components
      - Copy the code for the `TabsDemo` component and import it into your React application where you want to use it.
```

  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardFooter,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card"
import {
  Tabs,

} from "@/components/ui/tabs"

- Rendering the Component:
      - Place the `TabsDemo` component within your JSX to render it on the desired page or component.
- Customization:
      - Customize the appearance and behavior of the tabs and their content as needed.
      - Adjust the content displayed within each tab to match your application's design and requirements.
      - **Example Usage**:
      	- Utilize these tabs to organize and display different categories of content, such as recent, popular, and trending items.
      	- Populate each tab with relevant content, such as articles, posts, or products, to provide users with organized access to different types of information.
      	- Implement actions or interactions within each tab's content, such as commenting, sharing, or liking, to engage users and enhance the user experience.
