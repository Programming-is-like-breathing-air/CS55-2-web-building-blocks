# Navigation Component


**Contributed by Yingjian Di**

This is a function that helps users select what they want.

## Basic Component
### Design:
The `NavigationMenuDemo` component is a React component specifically designed to manage navigation through a dropdown menu interface. It is built using several styled components from a UI library, including `NavigationMenu`, `NavigationMenuList`, `NavigationMenuItem`, `NavigationMenuTrigger`, `NavigationMenuContent`, and `NavigationMenuLink`. These components are organized to provide a straightforward and intuitive navigation experience, featuring a collapsible menu that expands upon user interaction. 
### How to behave:
- Toggle Functionality: Utilizes a state variable `isOpen` to manage the display of the dropdown menu, which users can open or close by clicking the `NavigationMenuTrigger`. 
- Event Handling: Includes methods to prevent the dropdown menu from closing inadvertently when a user clicks within the dropdown content, thus enhancing the usability of the menu during interaction. 
### How to use it:
- Installation
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `navigation` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add navigation-menu 
```
- Usage:
To integrate the `navigation` into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import {
  NavigationMenu,
  NavigationMenuContent,
  NavigationMenuIndicator,
  NavigationMenuItem,
  NavigationMenuLink,
  NavigationMenuList,
  NavigationMenuTrigger,
  NavigationMenuViewport,
} from "@/components/ui/navigation-menu";


```

```
<NavigationMenu>
  <NavigationMenuList>
    <NavigationMenuItem>
      <NavigationMenuTrigger>Item One</NavigationMenuTrigger>
      <NavigationMenuContent>
        <NavigationMenuLink>Link</NavigationMenuLink>
      </NavigationMenuContent>
    </NavigationMenuItem>
  </NavigationMenuList>
</NavigationMenu>


```
- Logic:
```
export function NavigationMenuDemo() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  // Toggle the display state of the drop-down menu on click
  const toggleDropdown = () => {
    setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  };
  // Stop event bubbling to prevent the menu from closing when the drop-down content is clicked
  const handleDropdownClick = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
  };
```
- Customization:
The style of the drop-down menu is set through inline styles, such as minimum width, adaptive width, internal margins, etc.
Each link also has inline style settings, such as block-level display, internal margins, no text decoration, text color, etc.
<Dropdown />
