# Button Component

**Contributed by Yutong Shi and Yingjian Di**

## Basic Component
### Design:
The **BasicButton** component is a React functional component that showcases a button with toast functionality. It utilizes the **Button** component from a UI library to render the button. When clicked, the button triggers a toast notification via the **useToast** hook, displaying a message ("Button clicked!") and an action button ("Undo").

### How to behave:
 - User Interaction:
Clicking the button triggers the **onClick** event, which in turn calls the **toast** function to display a toast notification.

### How to use it:
- Installation: Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the Button component and toast functionality. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following commands:
```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast
```
- Usage: Import the Button, useToast, Toaster, and ToastAction into your React application.
```
import { Button } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/use-toast"
import { Toaster } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toaster";
import { ToastAction } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toast";
```
- Button Functionality:
     - Clicking the button provides visual feedback through a toast notification.
- Feedback Mechanisms:
     - Toast Notification: Upon clicking the button, a brief toast notification appears with the message "Button clicked!" and an "Undo" action button.
- Customization Considerations:
     - Toast Styling: Developers can customize toast appearance and behavior, including duration, position, and styling.
     - Button Styling: The button's appearance can be customized using the **variant** prop, with "outline" indicating an outline-style button.

     - Clicking the button triggers the **onClick** event handler.
     - Inside the event handler, the **toast** function from the **useToast** hook is called to display a toast notification.

### How to use it:

## Trigger Button
### Design:

   The **TriggerButton** component is a React functional component designed to showcase a button with toggle functionality. It imports the **Button** component from a UI library and utilizes the **useState** hook to manage the state of the button's clicked status. When clicked, the button toggles between displaying "Clicked" and "Click Me" text.

### How to behave:

   - User Interaction:
     - Clicking the button toggles its clicked state between true and false.

<SuccessfulButton />

## Loading Button
### Design:

   The **ButtonLoading** component is a React functional component designed to showcase a button with a loading spinner. It imports the **Loader2** component from the "lucide-react" library and the **Button** component from a UI library. The button is rendered in a disabled state with a loading spinner and a text message indicating that the user needs to wait.

### How to behave:

   - User Interaction:
     - The button is rendered in a disabled state, preventing user interaction while indicating that an action is in progress.
     - The loading spinner inside the button provides visual feedback to the user that something is happening in the background.

### How to use it:

   - Button Functionality: The button serves as a visual indicator to inform users that an action is currently being processed.
   - Customization Considerations:
     - Loader Styling: Developers can customize the appearance.
     - Button Text: The text message displayed alongside the loading spinner can be customized to provide more specific information about the action being processed.

## Hover Button

### Design:

   The **HoverButton** component is a React functional component designed to showcase a button with hover effect functionality.

When hovered over, the button's background color changes to indicate the hover effect.

### How to behave:

   - User Interaction:
     - Moving the mouse pointer over the button triggers the **onMouseEnter** event, setting the **isHovered** state to true.
     - Moving the mouse pointer away from the button triggers the **onMouseLeave** event, setting the **isHovered** state to false.
     - The button's background color changes dynamically based on its hover status, providing visual feedback to the user.

### How to use it:

   - Button Functionality: Hovering over the button changes its background color to indicate the hover effect.
   - Customization Considerations:
     - Hover Effect: Developers can customize the hover effect by adjusting the button's background color.

### Design:

   The **FocusButton** component is a React functional component designed to showcase a button with focus effect functionality. It imports the **Button** component from a UI library and utilizes the **useState** hook to manage the state of the button's focus status. Additionally, it utilizes the **useToast** hook to display a toast notification when the button is clicked. When focused, the button's box shadow changes to indicate the focus effect.

### How to behave:

   - User Interaction:
     - Focusing on the button triggers the **onFocus** event, setting the **isFocused** state to true.
     - Blurring from the button triggers the **onBlur** event, setting the **isFocused** state to false.
     - Clicking the button triggers the **onClick** event, displaying a toast notification with the message "Button clicked!".
     - The button's box shadow changes dynamically based on its focus status, providing visual feedback to the user.
