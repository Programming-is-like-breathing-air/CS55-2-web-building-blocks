# File Upload Component

**Contributed by Chaoyang Li**

## Basic Component

### Design:
This component provides a file upload interface allowing users to select and upload files. It consists of a button labeled "Choose File" that triggers the file selection dialog when clicked. After selecting a file, the name of the chosen file is displayed next to the button. Additionally, a "Upload File" button appears below the selected file name, allowing users to initiate the upload process.

### How to behave:
- File Selection: Clicking on the "Choose File" button opens the file selection dialog, allowing users to select a file from their device. After selecting a file, its name is displayed next to the button.
- File Upload: Once a file is selected, the "Upload File" button becomes visible, allowing users to upload the selected file. Clicking on the "Upload File" button triggers the upload process, which typically involves sending the file data to a server for processing.
