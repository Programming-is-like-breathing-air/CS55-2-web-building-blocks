# Toast Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu**
## Basic Toast 

### Design:
The `ToastWithTitle` component consists of a button and a toaster notification system. It utilizes a styled Button with an "outline" variant for clear visual distinction and accessibility in the user interface. The design emphasizes straightforward interaction, where the button's appearance and behavior are tailored to facilitate user engagement and provide immediate feedback via the toast message.

### How to behave: 
- Interaction Response:
When the user clicks the button, the onClick event handler is executed. This handler first logs a message to the console indicating that the button has been clicked, and then calls the toast function to display a notification. The content of the notification is "Message has been sent.", informing the user that the message has been successfully sent.

- Feedback Mechanism:
The component utilizes the Toaster component to display the notification message. This is a visual feedback mechanism that temporarily displays a message box on the screen to inform the user of the results of their action.

### How to use it: 
- Installation 
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Toast` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
``` 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add toast
```
- Usuage
To integrate the `Toast` component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/toast/use-toast"
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toast/toaster";
```
```
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const buttonText = "Show Toast with title";

  return (
    <>
      <Toaster />
      <Button
        variant="outline"
        onClick={() => {
          toast({
            title: "Uh oh! Something went wrong.",
            description: "There was a problem with your request.",
          });
        }}
      >
        {buttonText}
      </Button>
    </>
  );
```
- Customization:
Developers can modify the title and description within the toast call to suit various contexts or error messages. 
```
toast({
        title: "Uh oh! Something went wrong.",
        description: "There was a problem with your request.",
    });
```

<TitleToast />

## Toast with Action
### Design:
The `ToastWithAction` component is a sophisticated feedback mechanism in a React application. The `Button` from a UI library triggers these notifications. The component enhances user engagement by not only displaying an informative message but also offering an actionable option within the toast. 

### How to behave: 
The user initiates interaction by clicking a button labeled "Show Toast with title". Upon clicking, two primary actions occur: a console log indicates the button click event, and the `toast` method is called with an object that contains a title and description, prompting a toast notification with these details to appear. This demonstrates the ability to provide immediate feedback to the user in response to their actions through a toast message, which is useful for indicating success, warnings, errors, or informational messages. 

### How to use it: 
```
  const { toast } = useToast()
    const buttonText = "Show Toast with action";

    return (
        <>
            <Toaster />
            <Button
                variant="outline"
                onClick={() => {
                    toast({
                        title: "Uh oh! Something went wrong.",
                        description: "There was a problem with your request.",
                        action: <ToastAction altText="Try again">Try again</ToastAction>,
                    })
                }}
            >
                {buttonText}
            </Button>
        </>
    )
```
<ActionToast />
