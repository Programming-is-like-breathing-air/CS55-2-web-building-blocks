# Tags Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu**

Tags component categorizes content with interactive labels.

## Basic Tags Component
### Design:
The `InnovativeTags` component consists of four `Badge` instances, each displaying a different style variant: `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, and `outline`. Each badge is defined by a `variant` attribute that specifies its unique visual style, and includes a text label to clarify its purpose. To maintain visual consistency and neatness, all badges except the first one are spaced apart with a `marginLeft: '10px'` setting.

### How to behave: 
- Direct Usage:
Incorporate the `InnovativeTags` component into any part of a React application where badge display is needed. These badges can be used to indicate the status, category, or importance of items.

- Flexible Layout:
Thanks to their uniform margins and clear visual differentiation, these badges can be flexibly added to various UI layouts without compromising the overall design consistency.

### How to use it: 
- Installation 
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Badge` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
``` 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add badge
```
- Usuage
To integrate the `Badge` component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"
```
```
   <>
      <Badge variant="default" >Badge</Badge>
      <Badge variant="secondary" style={{marginLeft: '10px' }}>Secondary</Badge>
      <Badge variant="destructive" style={{marginLeft: '10px' }}>Destructive</Badge>
      <Badge variant="outline" style={{marginLeft: '10px' }}>Outline</Badge>
    </>
```
- Customization:
Developers can modify the content and style within the toast call to suit various contexts. 
```
<Badge variant="secondary" style={{marginLeft: '10px' }}>Secondary</Badge>
```
