# Chat Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu & Nuojin Zhang & Xinyu Chen**

## Normal Chat
### Design

The NormalChat component is designed to function as a straightforward messaging interface. It employs a card layout to encapsulate conversation threads between users, providing a clear and concise UI for sending and receiving messages.

### How to behave:
- Card: Serves as the outer container with a rounded and shadowed design to elevate the chat interface.
- CardHeader: Displays user information and sets the context of the conversation.
- CardContent: Contains the message threads and input form for new messages.
- Message Display: Messages are displayed in chronological order, with sent messages aligned to the right and received messages aligned to the left. Each message type has distinct background colors to visually separate the user's messages from those received.
- Sending Messages: Users can type messages into an input field and send them by pressing a button adorned with a send icon. If the input field is empty, the send button is disabled to prevent the sending of empty messages.
- Notifications: Upon sending a message, a toast notification is displayed, confirming the sent message content, which enhances user feedback and interaction.

### How to use it:
- Install Necessary Packages
```
npm install styled-components
npm install lucide-react
```
- Component Imports
Make sure all components and hooks used in NormalChat are properly imported from their respective libraries or files. Hereâ€™s a checklist and example import lines you might need:
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Input } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/input";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/button";
import { useToast } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/use-toast";
import { Toaster } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toaster";
import { SendHorizontal } from "lucide-react";

```

## Chat With Attachment
### Design
The AttachmentChat component is designed to enhance a standard chat interface by incorporating file upload functionality, including the ability to send and preview images directly within the chat.

### How to behave:
- Sending Text and Files: Users can type messages in an input field or upload files using a file input hidden behind a button. The chat interface handles both text messages and file uploads, displaying text directly and providing a thumbnail preview for images or a link for other file types.
- File Upload Feedback: Upon uploading a file, the chat dynamically displays a thumbnail for images or a file name for other types of files. This immediate feedback ensures that users understand what content they have uploaded and are about to send.
- Interaction: The component provides interactive elements such as the file upload button and the send message button. These are strategically placed to encourage user interaction and facilitate a seamless chat experience. The file links are clickable, opening the file in a new tab for easy access and viewing.


### How to use it:
- Installation and Setup:
Ensure your project is set up with React and has necessary dependencies installed. You'll need to have a proper UI component library for the card, button, input elements, and icons, as well as state management using **`React's`** useState.

- Integrating the Component:
Include the AttachmentChat in your React application by placing it in a suitable container within your app's component structure.

- Customization
Message Bubble Styles: You can modify the messageStyles object to change the appearance of message bubbles. This includes adjusting colors, padding, margins, and borders to fit your application's theme.
```
const messageStyles = {
  sent: {
    backgroundColor: '#007bff', // Example: Change to a different shade for sent messages
    color: 'white',
    borderRadius: '10px',
    padding: '12px',
    margin: '5px 0',
    wordBreak: 'break-word',
    maxWidth: '300px'
  },
  received: {
    backgroundColor: '#e9ecef', // Example: Lighter gray for received messages
    color: 'black',
    borderRadius: '10px',
    padding: '12px',
    margin: '5px 0',
    wordBreak: 'break-word',
    maxWidth: '300px'
  }
};
```
**Card and Button Styles:** Customize the card container and buttons to match your design system. You can edit the existing styles applied inline or through CSS classes.
```
<Card className="w-full max-w-md bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg overflow-hidden" style={{ width: '500px' }}>
  // Other components
</Card>
```
