# Tour Component

**Contributed by Nuojin Zhang**
## Design

The **TourComponent** is a React functional component that guides users through a sequence of interactive elements. It utilizes buttons and visually highlights each element in a sequential flow, allowing users to proceed through the guided tour steps.

## How to Behave

- **Component Structure**:
  - **Header**: Displays the tour's title.
  - **Content Section**: Displays the "Begin Tour" button and steps with interactive buttons.
  - **Tour Steps**: Shows a description of each highlighted step when the tour is active.

- **User Interaction**:
  - The user starts the tour by clicking the "Begin Tour" button.
  - Each step is highlighted one at a time, with a tooltip showing its description.
  - Users navigate between steps using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
  - The tour finishes when the user reaches the last step and clicks "Finish".

## How to Use It

- Installation

Ensure your project includes the necessary UI components. If not already installed, you can add them via npm:

```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```
- Customization
Developers can customize the step titles, descriptions, and button styles to suit specific application requirements.

To modify the steps in the tour, update the steps array:
```
const steps = [
    {
      title: "Upload File",
      description: "Put your files here.",
      target: ref1,
    },
    {
      title: "Save",
      description: "Save your changes.",
      target: ref2,
    },
    {
      title: "Other Actions",
      description: "Click to see other actions.",
      target: ref3,
    },
];
```
To modify the tour behavior, update the button click handlers:
```
const handleNext = () => {
    setTourStep((prev) => (prev < steps.length ? prev + 1 : 0));
};

const handlePrevious = () => {
    setTourStep((prev) => (prev > 0 ? prev - 1 : 0));
};

const handleFinish = () => {
    setTourStep(0);
};
```

<Tour />
