# Radio Group Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu**

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same `name`. Using radio buttons, users may select only one option from a collection of mutually incompatible options.

## Basic Radio Group Component

### Design:
The RadioGroupForm component utilizes react-hook-form and zod for form state management and validation, featuring three radio button options ("all", "mentions", "none") for notification preferences, styled with custom components and flexible Flexbox layout, ensuring a clear and understandable user interface.

### How to behave: 
- Form Submission:
When a user selects an option and submits the form, the onSubmit function is called. This function logs the submitted data and displays the values through the toast function, informing the user that the submission has been successful.

- Feedback Mechanism:
The Toaster component is used to display toast notifications, providing real-time feedback to the user. This method of feedback effectively communicates the status of the form processing to the user.

### How to use it: 
- Installation 
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Radio Group` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
``` 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
```
- Usuage
To integrate the these component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library:
```
import { Button } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/button"
import {
    Dialog,
    DialogClose,
    DialogContent,
    DialogDescription,
    DialogFooter,
    DialogHeader,
    DialogTitle,
    DialogTrigger,
} from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/dialog"
import { useToast } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/use-toast"
import { Toaster } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toaster";

```

- Customization:
Developers can modify the content and style within the toast call to suit various contexts. 
```
<FormLabel >Notify me about...</FormLabel>
```

<CompletedRadioGroup />
