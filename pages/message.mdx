# Message Component

**Contributed by Hexin Zheng**

## 1. Design:

The `Message` component is a React component designed to display interactive, customizable toast notifications within a React application (Combine `Toast` and `Button` components). It utilizes a combination of custom hooks and functional components to provide a seamless experience in notifying users about important information or actions. This component is crucial for enhancing user engagement and providing timely feedback in a visually appealing manner.

## 2. How to Behave:

The `Message` component supports various types of messages, including informational, warning, error, and success notifications. It features an easy-to-use interface with the capability to include icons and flexible styling. The component ensures that messages are responsive and accessible, providing users with a clear understanding of the application's states or required actions.

## 3. How to Use the Message Component:

To integrate the `Message` component into your React application, you can follow this sample code snippet. The component leverages a custom hook for toast functionality and a button to trigger the display of the message.
```
import { Button } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/use-toast"
import { Toaster } from "../../../../../styles/components/ui/toast/toaster";
```
## MessageNormal
Use `InfoCircledIcon ` to show the basic message here.
<MessageNormal  />

## MessageSuccess
Use `CheckCircledIcon ` to show the success message here.
<MessageSuccess  />

## MessageError
Use `CrossCircledIcon  ` to show the error message here.
<MessageError  />

## MessageWarning
Use `ExclamationTriangleIcon  ` to show the warning message here.
<MessageWarning  />

## MessageDuration
Use the attribute `duration` in the toast configuration to define how long the toast notification remains visible on the screen before it automatically disappears.
<MessageDuration  />

## MessageLoading
The component uses `LottieAnimation`, a popular library for rendering animation data exported as JSON from Adobe After Effects, specifically animations that indicate loading or processing.
Use the code below to install `lottie-web`.
```
npm install lottie-web
```
 And then use `LottieAnimation ` to show the loading message here.
<MessageLoading  />


## MessageSequential
Combine `loading message` and `success message` together and use `showMessages` function to control message show up and disappears.
<MessageSequential  />
