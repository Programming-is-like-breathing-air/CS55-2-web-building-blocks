# Timeline Component
**Contributed by Yingjian Di**

This is an timeline to show progress.

## Basic Component
### Design:
The TimelinePage component is a simple React functional component that visualizes the steps of a development process using a custom Timeline and TimelineItem components. The component imports Timeline and TimelineItem from a local style and component library, suggesting that it is part of a larger, possibly internally maintained UI framework. The steps in the development process are hardcoded into the steps array within the component, each represented by a label ('Think', 'Design', 'Code', 'Deploy').

### How to behave:
The component renders a div that includes a header displaying the text "Development Process" and a Timeline component. Inside the Timeline, a map function iterates over the steps array, creating a TimelineItem for each step. Each TimelineItem is given a unique key using its index in the array and is labeled according to the label property of each step object. This is a standard approach to rendering lists in React, ensuring each item is uniquely identified for React's rendering engine.
### How to use it:
- Installation
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the Link component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 

- Usage:
To integrate the `Timeline` component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the UI library:
```
import { Timeline, TimelineItem } from "@/components/ui/timeline";
```
```
<<Timeline>
                {steps.map((step, index) => (
                    <TimelineItem key={index} label={step.label} />
                ))}
            </Timeline>
```

- Customization:
     - Use can change step text what they need and user can add more steps.
