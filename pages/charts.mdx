# Charts Component

**Contributed by Hexin Zheng**

## 1. Design:

The `Charts` component is a React component designed for visualizing data through interactive charts and graphs. It leverages the capabilities of Chart.js within the React ecosystem to render responsive and customizable charts. This component is key in presenting complex data in an understandable and visually appealing format, enhancing the userâ€™s ability to analyze and interpret data trends.

## 2. How to behave:

The `Charts` component serves as a dynamic tool for data representation that supports various chart types such as bar, line, pie, and scatter plots. It provides interactivity such as tooltips, zooming, and panning to aid in detailed data exploration. Each chart element is interactive, allowing users to delve into specifics by interacting with data points and legends. The focus is on delivering a seamless integration of Chart.js features within a React application, ensuring that users can effectively engage with the data presented.
