# Search Component

**Contributed by Yuqing Wu**

Search component is an input component that can provide users to type words in the search bar and then by clicking the search button, user can get the corresponding results.

## Basic Search Component

### Design:
The `BasicSearch` component is a React functional component designed for inputting and submitting search queries. It integrates a form validation schema using Zod for input validation, ensuring search queries meet specific criteria. The component is built using a combination of custom UI components from the application's library, including `Button`, `Input`, and various form-related components. The `useToast` hook is also employed to provide user feedback upon form submission. 

### How to behave: 
When the user submits the form after entering a search query, the form data is validated against the `FormSchema` defined by Zod. If the input meets the criteria (in this case, a minimum of 2 characters for `searchValue`), a toast notification is displayed with the search query, and console logs track the initiation and completion of the search process. If the input does not meet the criteria, a validation message will appear. 

### How to use it: 
- Installation 
Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the Search component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 
``` 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add toast 
npm install @hookform/resolvers/zod 
npm install react-hook-form 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add input 
npm shadcn-ui@latest add button 
``` 
- Form Submission:
Users can enter a search term into the input field and submit the form. The search operation will only proceed if the input passes the validation criteria set by Zod. 

- Input Validation: 
The form employs Zod validation to ensure that the user inputs at least 2 characters, displaying an error message otherwise. 

- Styling Flexibility: 
The `Input` component has an extended width style, and the `Button` is styled with a margin-top, showing how styles can be applied directly to components for custom layouts. The `BasicSearch` component facilitates a user-friendly search experience within the application, enforcing input criteria for better search results and user interaction transparency through notifications and messages.
