## Basic Component
### Design:

   - **Avatar Display**:
     - The avatar exhibits the user's GitHub profile picture and username.

     - The dropdown menu offers options for profile management, including profile viewing, billing, and settings adjustment.
     - Additionally, there is a link to the user's GitHub profile within the menu.
   - **User Interaction**:
     - Clicking on the avatar opens the dropdown menu, allowing users to navigate through the available options.
     - Selecting the GitHub option redirects users to the specified GitHub page in a new tab.
