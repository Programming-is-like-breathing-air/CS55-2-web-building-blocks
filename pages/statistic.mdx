# Statistic Component

**Contributed by Yutong Shi**

## Basic Component
### Design:
The **StatisticNormal** component is designed to display statistical information in a visually appealing and informative manner. It utilizes the **Statistic** component from the UI library to present various statistics, including active users and account balance. The component also includes a loading state indicator for asynchronous data fetching and a button for user interaction.
### How to behave:
     - **Statistic Display**:
     - The component showcases two instances of the **Statistic** component, each presenting a different statistic with corresponding values.
     - The first set of statistics includes "Active Users" and "Account Balance (CNY)" with numerical values.
     - The second set of statistics displays "Active Users" with a loading indicator, indicating that data is being fetched asynchronously.
   - **User Interaction**:
     - Users can interact with the "Recharge" button, although its functionality is not explicitly defined within the component. Developers can customize its behavior according to application requirements.

### How to use it:

   - **Statistic Integration**:
     - Developers can integrate the **StatisticNormal** component into their React applications to visualize statistical data effectively.
     - Customize the component by adjusting the statistical titles, values, and precision as needed to reflect the relevant information for the application.
     - Ensure proper styling and layout adjustments to align with the overall design aesthetics and user experience goals of the application.
     - Utilize the loading state indicator when fetching data asynchronously to provide users with feedback on the ongoing process.

## Variants

## IncardStatistic
### Design:
 The **IncardStatistic** component is designed to display statistical information within cards, providing a visually appealing presentation of data. It utilizes the **Card** and **Statistic** components from the UI library to create a layout with statistics indicating the active and idle states. The component includes arrows to represent changes in statistics, with green indicating an increase and red indicating a decrease.

### How to behave:
   - **Card Layout**:
     - The component renders two instances of the **Card** component, each containing statistical information.
     - One card represents the "Active" state, while the other represents the "Idle" state.
   - **Statistic Presentation**:
     - Each card displays a statistic value with corresponding arrows to indicate changes.
     - Green arrows with positive values signify an increase, while red arrows with negative values denote a decrease.
   - **Value Precision**:
     - The precision of the statistical values is set to two decimal places to provide accurate representations of percentages.
   - **Styling and Layout**:
     - The layout of the component ensures proper spacing and alignment for an organized presentation of information.

### How to use it:
   - **Integration**:
     - Developers can integrate the **IncardStatistic** component into their React applications to showcase statistical data within cards.
     - Customize the component by adjusting the statistical values, colors, and arrows to reflect the relevant information for the application.
     - Ensure proper styling and layout adjustments to align with the overall design aesthetics and user experience goals of the application.
     - Test the component within your application to verify its functionality and appearance under various conditions.

## CountdownStatistic
### Design:

  The **CountdownStatistic** component is designed to display countdown timers indicating the remaining time until a specified target date. It utilizes the **Countdown** and **Scountdown** components from the UI library to create countdown timers at different levels of granularity, including days.

### How to behave:

   - **Countdown Timers**:
     - The component renders two countdown timers: one at the day level and the other providing a more detailed countdown.
     - Each countdown timer updates dynamically to reflect the remaining time until the specified target date.
   - **Granularity**:
     - The "Day Level" countdown timer displays the remaining days until the target date, providing a high-level overview of the time remaining.
     - The "Countdown" timer offers a more detailed countdown, including hours, minutes, and seconds, for a more precise indication of the remaining time.
   - **Styling and Layout**:
     - The component's layout ensures proper spacing and alignment to present the countdown timers clearly and prominently.
     - Each countdown timer is accompanied by a title indicating its level of granularity for easy identification.

### How to use it:

     - **Integration**:
     - Developers can integrate the **CountdownStatistic** component into their React applications to display countdown timers for various purposes, such as event countdowns, product launches, or deadlines.
     - Customize the component by adjusting the target date and any additional styling or layout preferences to suit the application's requirements.
     - Ensure that the target date is set to the desired deadline or event date to accurately reflect the remaining time until that point.
     - Test the component within your application to verify its functionality and appearance under various conditions, such as different screen sizes and target dates.
