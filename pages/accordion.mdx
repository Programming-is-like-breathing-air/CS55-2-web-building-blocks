# Accordion Component

**Contributed by Hexin Zheng** 

## 1. Design: 

The `Accordion` component is a React component designed for displaying collapsible content panels. It is part of the Shadcn UI library, which supports configurable behaviors such as single or multiple panels open simultaneously. This flexibility allows it to be used for FAQs, nested menus, or for hiding and showing content on demand. Each panel can be styled individually, maintaining the library's cohesive design system. 

  

## 2. How to behave: 

The `Accordion` component is interactive, allowing users to expand or collapse content as needed. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern, ensuring accessibility and usability. The component can operate in 'single' or 'multiple' modes, determined by the `type` prop. In 'single' mode, only one panel can be open at a time, which is useful for FAQs where only one answer should be visible at a time. In 'multiple' mode, users can open multiple panels simultaneously. 

  

## 3. How to Use the Accordion Component 

### 3.1. Installation: 

Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the `Accordion` component. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following command: 

``` 

npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion 

``` 

### 3.2. Usage: 

  

To integrate the `Accordion` component into your React application, include the necessary imports from the Shadcn UI library: 

``` 

import { 

  Accordion, 

  AccordionContent, 

  AccordionItem, 

  AccordionTrigger 

} from "@/components/ui/accordion"; 

``` 

### 3.3. Rendering the Component: 

  

Embed the `Accordion` component within your JSX code where you want it to be displayed: 

``` 

<Accordion type="single" collapsible> 

  <AccordionItem value="item-1"> 

    <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger> 

    <AccordionContent> 

      Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern. 

    </AccordionContent> 

  </AccordionItem> 

</Accordion> 

``` 

### 3.4. Customization: 

Customize the Accordion component by modifying the component's style, event handlers, and functionality to better match the design and requirements of your application. The component can be styled to fit the aesthetics of your website while maintaining user accessibility and interaction guidelines. For example, different components such as buttons, images, lists and avatars can be added to enrich the functionality of Accordion. 
## Simple Accordion

The **`Simple Accordion`** component is a basic accordion component that contains a title and a content area. The content area is hidden by default and can be shown by clicking on the title.

You can add more Accordion collapsible sections by adding more Accordion components. Please follow the code example below to add more Accordion components.

<Accordion />

## Accordion with Button


The **`AccordionButton`** component that incorporates a customized accordion control with clickable buttons. The component uses imports from a project's UI component library, specifically **``accordion``** and **``button``** components, as well as toast notification functionality.
<AccordionWithButton />

## Accordion with Button and Picture

The **`Accordion component with buttons and images`** builds upon the Button Accordion component, which in turn is based on the Simple Accordion component. It incorporates `<img>` and `<Button>` tags into `<AccordionContent>`.

This component is designed to display a list of items, each accompanied by an image and a button, facilitating navigation to different pages or the opening of modals. With images included, it becomes easier to identify items and present more information about them.

## Constom configuration of the Accordion component

The **`Accordion`** component family is designed to be flexible and customisable. It is designed to be used in a variety of different ways.

You can configure the Accordion component to have a different title, content, button, and picture by mixing and matching. Please follow the code example and demo below to see how to configure the Accordion component.

<AccordionMix />

## Accordion with List

The **`Accordion with List`** component is built on top of the **`Simple Accordion`** component. The design adds a list to the content area. However, there are differences between the **`Simple Accordion`** component and the **`Accordion with List`** component. The **`Simple Accordion`** component is designed to show and hide content, whereas **`Accordion with List`** component is designed to show a list of items.

You can easily add more items to the list by adding more list items. Please follow the code example below to see how to add more list items. In this example, we have populated the list with a list of University Campus Locations, as well as a list of University Faculties and Schools.

<AccordionWithList />

## Accordion with List and Avatar

The **`Accordion with List and Avatar`** component is built on top of the **`Accordion with List`** component. The design adds an avatar as well as a number of short-text titles to the list item. The avatar is a picture that is used to identify the item or the personal, and the short-texts are used to display more information about the item or the personal.

You can easily add more items to the list by adding more list items. Please follow the code example below to see how to add more list items. In this example, we have populated the list with the list of the current Australian Government Ministers as well as the list of the current Australian Government Shadow Ministers. **(Note: The list and the positions are correct as of September 25, 2023.)**
