# Watermark Component

**Contributed by Yutong Shi**

## Basic Component
### Design:
The **WatermarkNormal** component is designed to apply a custom watermark to the content displayed within it. It utilizes the **Watermark** component from the UI library to overlay a watermark text or logo on top of the content.

### How to behave:
    - **Watermark Overlay**:
     - The component overlays the specified watermark content (text or logo) on top of the content provided within it.
     - The watermark appears translucent, allowing the underlying content to remain visible while still indicating the presence of the watermark.
   - **Customization**:
     - Developers can customize the watermark content to display any desired text or logo, such as a company name, logo, or disclaimer.
     - The component provides flexibility in terms of watermark placement, allowing developers to position it appropriately within the content area.
   - **Styling**:
     - The component's styling ensures that the watermark is visually distinct from the underlying content, making it easily identifiable.
     - Developers can further customize the watermark's appearance, such as its font, size, color, and opacity, to suit the application's design requirements.
### How to use it:
   - **Integration**:
     - To use the **WatermarkNormal** component, developers simply wrap the content they wish to watermark with the **Watermark** component and specify the desired watermark content.
     - Customize the watermark content by providing the desired text or logo as the `content` prop of the **Watermark** component.
     - Optionally, adjust the watermark's appearance by applying additional styling to the **Watermark** component or its children.
     - Test the component within your application to ensure that the watermark appears as intended and does not obstruct the underlying content.
