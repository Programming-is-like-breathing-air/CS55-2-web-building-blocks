## Basic Component
### Design:

   The **CalendarDemo** component is a React functional component designed to showcase a calendar component with toast functionality. It imports the **Calendar** component from a UI library and the **useToast** hook along with associated **Toaster** and **ToastAction** components for displaying toast notifications. The calendar allows users to select a single date, and upon selection, a toast notification is triggered to display the selected date.

### How to behave:

   - User Interaction:

     - A toast notification is triggered, displaying the selected date's information.
   - Toast Notification:
     - The toast notification includes the selected date's information and an "Undo" action button.

### How to use it:

   - Installation: Ensure that your project includes all necessary dependencies for the Calendar component and toast functionality. If they are not already installed, add them via npm with the following commands:
    ```
